# Profile Page 3D Background and Input Highlighting Task

## Information Gathered
- Signup page has 3D background effects with floating blurred circles in neon colors (blue, purple, cyan)
- Signup form uses 3D card styling with gradient backgrounds, backdrop blur, and neon borders
- Signup inputs use "input-field" class with focus highlighting (neon-blue border and shadow)
- Profile page currently uses "hacker" theme with green colors and "input-hacker" class
- Profile form is in the 'profile' tab section

## Plan
- [ ] Add 3D background effects div to profile page (similar to signup)
- [ ] Wrap the profile form card with 3D card background layers
- [ ] Update input classes from "input-hacker" to "input-field" with neon focus styling
- [ ] Ensure form layout matches signup's professional 3D appearance

## Dependent Files to Edit
- frontend/pages/profile.js (main file to modify)

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test profile page at http://localhost:3000/profile to verify 3D background and input highlighting
- [ ] Check for any styling conflicts or missing CSS classes
- [ ] Ensure responsive design still works
